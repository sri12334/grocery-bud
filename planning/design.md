## Design Constraints

**Simplicity:** Keep the interface clean and intuitive for easy user
interaction. **Consistency:** Maintain consistent design elements and layout
throughout the page. **Responsiveness:** Ensure the design is responsive and
looks good on various screen sizes and devices. **Readability:** Use appropriate
font sizes, colors, and contrast for readability, especially for text input and
error messages. **Visual Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback for user
actions such as hover effects, button states, and item selection.
**Accessibility:** Design with accessibility in mind, including sufficient color
contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. **Scalability:**
Design the layout to accommodate a growing number of items without sacrificing
usability or visual appeal. **Loading Time:** Optimize images and other assets
to minimize loading times, especially for users on slower internet connections.
